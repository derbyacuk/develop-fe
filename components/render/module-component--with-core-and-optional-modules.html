This module aims to initiate the student in this area of professional education through the consideration of interaction skills that enable the client to feel heard and validated, yet if need be allowing the practitioner to obtain information needed for professional practice. As well as developing new skills of professional communication the student will consider ways of reflecting on interactions and encouraging others to reflect also.","details":"The student will examine in detail a specific model on interaction and reflection. S/he will consider the notion of the working alliance and will explore and reflect on the nature and importance of effective communication within this relationship. The student will be encouraged to integrate theoretical concepts and experiential work and consider its application when working with people working in a therapeutic and non-therapeutic environment.","credits":"20","assessment":["Coursework"]},"4TA502":{"code":"4TA502","title":"Expression and the Arts","introduction":"Through becoming a member of a closed group aimed at facilitating learning using a variety of art forms, the student will gain an understanding of the creative processes underlying the use of these art forms in self-expression.","details":"The student, through the use of the arts, will be encouraged to explore their values, attitudes and behaviour, and reflecting on their experience of the group creative process. As part of the closed group, the student will also be encouraged to show awareness of their personal rights and responsibilities with respect to the equality of others also engaged in this process.","credits":"20","assessment":["Coursework"]},"4TA504":{"code":"4TA504","title":"Human Development and Creativity","introduction":"This module aims to provide students with an appreciation of how humans develop. The ‘nature versus nurture’ debate will be explored; along with consideration of psychological; sociological and biological theories of development with a focus on the development of creativity.","details":"This module introduces learners to key theories applicable to practice in working with people. It aims to promote awareness, whilst developing understanding and insight, with which to evaluate differing experiences of the developmental process.","credits":"20","assessment":["Coursework"]},"4TA505":{"code":"4TA505","title":"Music and Musicianship","introduction":"This module offers a foundation for students on the Music pathway, in music and musicianship skills. The module acknowledges the vast cultural diversity in contemporary approaches to music-making and whilst performance and musical dexterity have their place, seeks to embrace students from a variety of musical backgrounds.","details":"<p>This module will give students the opportunity to develop and explore improvisational techniques in the context of arrangement and focused structured improvisation. Using both group and individual improvisations the processes underlying musical communication will be experienced, reflected upon and ultimately assessed through the performance of both group and individual semi-structured improvisations.</p><p>The module will also help students to build practical skills on their chosen instrument/s- formally and creatively- using pre-composed and improvised music. As students will be from a variety of musical traditions, instrument and musical content of study will be dependent on the musical outline adopted. Practical and musicianship skills will be assessed through the performance of pre-composed music from a composer of the student’s choice.</p>","credits":"20","assessment":["Practical"]},"4TA506":{"code":"4TA506","title":"Visual Art","introduction":"This module will introduce the student to the visual arts in a fine art environment, involving appropriate studio practice.

The subjective nature of the experience will be investigated with reference to notions of imagination, body, place and the ways in which these can form legitimate forms of knowledge and research; exploration of such knowledge will complement the consideration of positivist constructions of knowledge such as those to be found within the discipline of biomedicine.","details":"<p>The module will consider how terms like health, illness, stress, disease, disability and suffering are problematic and are shaped by the interdependent nature of private, personal and public forces that do not always fit neatly into predefined categories.</p><p>In a similar way, the political and historical forces upon experiences of inclusion and exclusion will be explored. As well as physical and psychological ailments the module also has space to consider non-medical experiences such as homelessness and unemployment.</p><p>To help negotiate these ideas the module will draw upon the World Health Organization’s International Classification of Functioning, which focuses upon health and functioning rather than symptoms and disabilities, and considers the impact of environmental and personal believes upon individual experiences.</p><p>Through encounters with individual stories the module aims to equip students with the empathic and critical faculties necessary to work with difference and diversity in a helping, supportive or healing capacity; this builds upon the first year modules Effective Interaction and Working Creatively with People 1 and helps to prepare students to creatively work with people in a helping or healing capacity such as they are asked to do in the second year module Working Creatively with People 2.</p>","credits":"20","assessment":["Coursework"]},"5TA503":{"code":"5TA503","title":"Interpersonal Development","introduction":"Building upon the key components of the arts as an aid to expression, and the value of reflective practice, this module involves the student becoming a member of a small process-oriented training group, facilitated by a member of the teaching team.","details":"<p>The module proposes that the understanding of the common forces and behaviours that can arise within groups is an important skill that can be transferred to a variety of situations that involves collaborative and team-based work. The emphasis is on interpersonal communication, the role of the individual in relation to the group, the nature of group dynamics, and the role of the arts as an aid to communication and problem solving within the group.</p><p>Whilst the training group operates within an educational context such training groups frequently move from the ‘outer’ level (the ventilation of feelings within a supportive relationship) to the ‘intermediate’ level (the clarification of feelings and their nature and origins within a deepening relationship). The group is a ‘training’ group rather than a ‘therapy’ group, but it does offer the possibility for therapeutic benefits to emerge.</p>","credits":"20","assessment":["Coursework"]},"5TA504":{"code":"5TA504","title":"Music and Musicianship 2","introduction":"This module focuses on developing students’ music and musicianship skills. Building on work carried out at level four in this subject, students will be encouraged to continue working with culturally diverse and contemporary approaches to music-making and further develop their critical awareness of music from different musical styles and genres. Although composition, performance and musical dexterity remain of key importance there is also an increased emphasis on their potential application and context.","details":"<p>Students will develop skills in original composition, assessment of which will comprise of two personal compositions reflecting individual musical development across the year. Compositions may be created and submitted within a standard western notation or developed through a medium more appropriate to the genre of music eg. A digital recording medium.</p><p>Students will also strengthen their understanding of the role of different improvisation elements in composition and performance by building on their experience of structured improvisation concerning harmony, melody, style and instrumentation. Improvisation skills will be assessed through a solo structured improvisation and a semi-structured group.</p><p>Performance skills are always central to this module and will be assessed through a performance of a short recital of pre-composed music by composers of the students’ choice. Both performance and composition skills will be further assessed through a 1500 word reflection highlighting the student’s musical development within an applied context.</p>","credits":"20","assessment":["Practical"]},"5TA505":{"code":"5TA505","title":"Performance","introduction":"In the performance-based arts it is common to collaborate with other art forms. This is equally so in the use of the arts in health and education were being able to work fluently with other arts practitioners is considered an important practitioner skill.","details":"<p>In this module students from the dance, drama and music pathways will engage in group creativity in which the different art forms are used together to produce a short performance. The process of developing the performance will be considered at depth focusing on how the student’s experience of their art form informs their engagement with other performers. The module also aims to help the student increase her/his creative versatility in performing using more that one art form.</p>","credits":"20","assessment":["Practical","Coursework"]},"5TA507":{"code":"5TA507","title":"Working Creatively with People 2","introduction":"This module builds upon Working Creatively with People I.
